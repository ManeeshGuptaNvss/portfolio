We will use cloud server to store the database of users. The database can be retrieved using a unique QR code of a user. Whenever a person approaches doctor, his data can be easily retrieved by getting a link through scanning his QR code. This will help in analysing one's medical background in less time and will result in more accurate treatment. In this way, a person doesn't have to carry documents all the time. Without actual documents, his data can be easily accessed and will help in keeping track of all the reports and medicines, that the person has ever gone through. This will result in leafless, virtual and  shielded ambiance.",
